# smear

This is a lisp like programming language that I am attempting to build

Lists:

(10 11 12) -> this is a list and its fine

hash map to store symbols.
list to show execution cycles.

(define x 10)

("+" -> add)
("-" -> sub)
("*" -> mul)
("/" -> div)
("%" -> div)

if  -> conditional statemetn -> (if (cond)
				(cond_true_statement)
				(cond_false_statement))

rep -> repitative statement -> (rep (cond) (statement)) 	# probably gettting discarded

def -> define value as symbolic link -> (define sym val) 

fn  -> declare a function which would have its own whole program   -> (fn (args) ...)
       like system. oof thats gonna be hard ;-) i freaking like it
