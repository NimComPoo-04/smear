# SMEAR

## TL;DR Transpiles to lua therefore dependency LUA (tested on version 5.1) also the error handeling is very bad.

This is smear a very bad programming langauge.
It is kind of like lisp without the best part of lisp
(SCUFFED LISP which is kind of what smear kinda symbolizes)

But I don't care like literally

It can take input and put out output and thats all that is
required.

It is my first langauge and I am very happy that i could make it without
giving the frick up!!

I wanted to roll my own vm but it turns out its gooing to
take a lot of time but i had to get this langauge out before 
chrismas (you know as a christmas present to myself) so i just 
transpiled to lua specificaly version 5.1 ('cause neovim ships with that).

That reveals my editor of choice does't it. Good I will flex my vimceps to 
all the world 'cause i am a total noob!!

and like Davie504 said *"My pp is small and ugly but it is my pp and i love it"*

If you (for what every reason) have the bright idea of using this
turd of a programming language just remember that it is buggy as buggy
as casu marzu.

yeah that is pretty much it idk what else to say.

Oh yeah I almost forgot the error handling of this language eats dirt
for dinner.
